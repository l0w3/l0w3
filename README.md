## Low Level

Lastly I've been very interested in learning about low level computer science, specially what revolves around Operating Systems and Hardware. For this purpose I am learning from the great tutorials from [asmtutor](https://asmtutor.com/), the amazing labs of [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/) and from the lectures (and book) [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).

The following links will bring you to the repositories where I upload my work related to this resources

As a pentester and aspiring security researcher, I am loking towards applying all this skills to finding new bugs of way of exploiting the existing ones. That's why I also research about vulnerabilities and try to explain the research as well as the exploit path in a repo called (N-daysResearch)[]. Check it out if you want to see my knowledge applyed to real problems

## Dev

Before becoming a pentester, I was a hobby programmer, that's why many of my projects are pure code. I would not consider myself a coder, but I can code my own scripts and programs if it comes necessary at some point.
