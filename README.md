## Low Level

Lastly I've been very interested in learning about low level computer science, specially what revolves around Operating Systems and Hardware. For this purpose I am learning from the great tutorials from [asmtutor](https://asmtutor.com/), the amazing labs of [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/) and from the lectures (and book) [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).

The following links will bring you to the repositories where I upload my work related to this resources
- [asmtutor](https://github.com/l0w3/asmtutor_execices): ![](https://geps.dev/progress/8)
- [pwncollege](https://github.com/l0w3/pwncollege): ![](https://geps.dev/progress/20)
- [Kernel From Scratch](kfs): ![](https://geps.dev/progress/1)

As a pentester and a security researcher I am constantly looking for new ways of exploiting systems and vulnerabilities. While learning all of above I apply it to real-live scenarios through exploiting N-Days or researching topics I am interested on. Below you can find some projects I am proud of having completed:
- [CVE-2019-18634: Sudo privilege escalation]()
- [Van Eck Interferences for monitor eavesdropping]()
- [RFID card cracking and locker room DoS]()
  
## Dev

My journey on Computer Science started as for many others with programming. I learned to code when I was 12 and since then, I coded almost everything I wanted to create. Below you can find a list of some of the projects I made over the years:
- [STEM Fellowship HSBDC 2022](https://github.com/l0w3/STEMFellowship_Alex_Andrei)
- [ACM - Music Classificator based on Spectrogram](https://github.com/l0w3/ACM)

When I becam interested in cybersecurity I oriented my developpment towards it. Below are some repositoies with code oriented towards cybersecurity such as malware development, defensive tools, etc.
- [Secure Folders](https://github.com/l0w3/SecureFolders)
- [goEnum](https://github.com/l0w3/goEnum/blob/main/main.go)
- [Process Injection](https://github.com/l0w3/process-injection)
